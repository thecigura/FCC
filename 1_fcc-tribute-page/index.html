      <p>The sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series consists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series_(F10)" target="_blank" title="BMW 5 Series (F10)">BMW F10</a> (sedan version), BMW F11 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring')
        and BMW F07 (fastback version, marketed as 'Gran Turismo') executive cars. The F10/F11/F07 was produced from 2010 to 2017 and is often collectively referred to as the F10.</p>
      <p>The F07 version is the first and only 5 Series to be produced in a fastback body style. The F10 generation is also the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a forced induction V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, a dual-clutch transmission
        (in the M5), active rear-wheel steering (called "Integral Active Steering"), electric power steering, double-wishbone front suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called "Black Panel Display") and automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant").
        A long-wheelbase sedan version (model code F18) was sold in China, Mexico and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>The F10 M5, introduced in 2011, is powered by the S63 twin-turbocharged V8 engine coupled to a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. It is the first M5 to use a forced induction engine.
        <p>
          <p>In February 2017, the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series_(G30)" target="_blank"><strong>BMW 5 Series (G30)</strong></a> began production as the successor to the F10.</p>
